<Text>Problem Plaza. This statue was built for the villagers of Carbwir to honor the brave Koowaalaas who, years ago, brought great prosperity to this village. 
For each of the eight Development Goals of the United Nations he achieved, a symbol has been forged out of the purest gold. The more a goal is represented, the more the symbol will shine. If a goal is poorly represented, the symbol will decay.</Text>

This used to be the primary source of food for the village. Unless you are foolish enough to try and repair the stables, please go away.</Text>

      <Text>Hello Tubbles!
You've just entered the Dreamworld. Should you ever get into a situation here in which you see no way out, you can just press {escape|start} to return to the village.

      <Text>We just actived your Axle Gizmo, this will allow you to rotate platforms across a certain axis.
First, you can select a group of platforms, indicated by their color, by pointing your crosshair at them. When selected, they will light up. The center of the group, around which the platforms are rotated, are indicated by the glowy thingies.
Then, you can rotate them, using your Axle Gizmo, down in your screen. Select an axis or rotation by using {Q and E or the scrollwheel|the shoulderbuttons}. The Gizmo's axis you've selected will rotate in the given direction.
Once you've selected the axis and/or rotation, use {left-click|press B} to apply your rotation.
In front of you are two platforms, orange and green, go ahead and test it out!</Text>

      <Text>Now that you've practiced rotating platforms, let's put it to use!
In front of you is a red group of platforms. Stand on the platform in front of you, select the group and rotate it along the horizontal axis twice to get across.
Yes, you could jump across, but this is good practice!</Text>

      <Text>Well done! Now you need to jump.
You've already learned how (remember, by pressing the {space bar|A button}). Do this now by jumping across the gaps.
P.S. There's cake at the end.</Text>

      <Text>Sorry, the cake was a lie.
In front of you is a green platform which you can't reach. Rotate it towards you, stand on it, and rotate it back to get across.</Text>

      <Text>For the next puzzle, you'll need to use a different axis. See if you can figure it out.
Hint: Think about your position when rotating the pink platform.</Text>

      <Text>Welcome back to the Dreamworld, Tubbles.
You have chosen to enter through the Stable and the problem for this puzzle is hunger. The stable has collapsed and the villagers have no other viable source of food. 
If you solve the puzzle, its real world effect will a be a rebuilt stable and therefore a steady foodsupply for the village.
On the meadow to your left is another sign that will help you solve the puzzle.</Text>

      <Text>This puzzle is about food! 
As you can see, there are two pairs of cows in this puzzle. Unlike platforms, they're not connected to a center (the glowing thingies), instead, they rotate around each other. Select one cow and it'll rotate around the other. And vice versa.
Your goal is to get both pairs to the other meadow, across the puzzle. Good luck!
P.S. If a cow falls down, the both of the pair will be respawned in this meadow.</Text>
